## [0-bubble_sort.c](./0-bubble_sort.c)

Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm

    Prototype: void bubble_sort(int *array, size_t size);
    You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements (See example below)

Write in the file 0-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

    in the best case
    in the average case
    in the worst case

## [1-insertion_sort_list.c](./1-insertion_sort_list.c)

Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm

    Prototype: void selection_sort(int *array, size_t size);
    You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements (See example below)

Write in the file 2-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Selection sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

    in the best case
    in the average case
    in the worst case
